#For performing the EDA, we will have to install and load the following packages:
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(DataExplorer)
library(pROC)
library(glmnet)
library(aqp)
library(soilDB)
# To access correlation matrix plot
library("PerformanceAnalytics")
```

# Upload the dataset
```{r}
CustomerRetention

```
# Answer 1.1
# Data preparation and Exploratory Data Analysis
# data frame has 6999 records and 20 variables, characteristics provided by the dim function
# Exploratory Data Analysis or EDA is a statistical approach or technique for analyzing data sets in order to summarize their important and main characteristics generally by using some visual aids. The EDA approach can be used to gather knowledge about the following aspects of data:

# Main characteristics or features of the data.
# The variables and their relationships.
# Finding out the important variables that can be used in our problem.

# Below is the performance of the EDA under two broad classifications:
#(1) Descriptive Statistics, which includes mean, median, mode, inter-quartile range, and so on.
#(2) Graphical Methods, which includes histogram, density estimation, box plots, and so on.
```{r}
dim(CustomerRetention)
```

#Displays the type and a preview of all columns as a row so that it's very easy to take in accoding to type of variables
```{r}
glimpse(CustomerRetention)

```

```{r}
#BasicSummary(CustomerRetention)
typeof(CustomerRetention)
```

#Data Inspection for EDA in R to know mean median min, max for all the variables that is comes in description data exploration 
```{r}
summary(CustomerRetention)
```

#Note that there is significant correlation of TotalCharges with Tenure and MonthlyCharges. If collinearity is an #issue for the method I am using then I will not use MonthlyCharges
```{r}
# I will create a subset with the numeric variables I want to explore correlations for
CustomerRetention.numeric <- CustomerRetention %>%
  select(Tenure,MonthlyCharges,TotalCharges)
chart.Correlation(CustomerRetention.numeric , histogram=TRUE, pch=19)

#Basic statistics, missing data, distribution, correlation, PCA.

#The target variable in our dataset is the status column so it is better to start with exploring this column. We can use a Bar to visualize the distribution.


#Graphical Method in EDA 

#Since we have already checked our data for missing values, blatant errors, and typos, we can now examine our data graphically in order to perform EDA. We will see the graphical representation under the following categories: 

#since most of the variables are factor so here using the bar graph 
# Current customer have more intwrest in monthly charges less than 25 that is more than 1000 customer however a slightly increasing and decreasing trend were seen throughout the all monthly charge plan 
# left customer statistics shows 75 monthly plan were most popuar while between 25 to 50 shows least intrestin plan 
```{r}

#visulization for total charges
#for trend totalcharges, current number of customer are more interested below 2500 monthly charges , the number of customers decline according to total charges were increasing

# Answer 1.3
```{r}
set.seed(2)
train <- sample(6999,6000)
CustomerRetention_Training <- CustomerRetention[train,]
CustomerRetention_Testing <- CustomerRetention[-train,]
str(CustomerRetention_Training)
str(CustomerRetention_Testing)
```


```{r}
CustomerRetention_Training <- CustomerRetention_Training %>% mutate(Status_new= as.factor(Status))
str(CustomerRetention_Training)
```

#Answer 2.1
# After analysis of the all models with different combination of vatiables i found status_new and Tenure is the best model As i see in Roc plot AUC (Area under the curve) is more close to TOP LEFT CORNER that is 0.738 .
# First notice that this coefficient is statistically significant (associated with a p-value < 0.05), so our model suggests that
# Coefficient for Tenure variable is -0.03869215 and p- value is  also -25.3873962 < 0.05 , Tenure does not influence the customer behaviour , that thery are leaving the serivices 

# Same ROC plot with 0.738 AUC i am getting with combination of variables status_new and monthlycharge
# Coefficient of monthlycharge variables is 0.01525974 that is positive number and p- value is 14.49112 > 0.05 so that monthlycharge is affecting the customer behaviour positively , As the monthlycharge increasing the customer behaviour might be tend to decrease the interest in the taking services anymore. same trend i can see in the data visulization part that as monthly charge increasing that leading to lose the nuber of status.

# seniourcitizen coefficient is 0.8708419 that indicate seniourcitizen influencing the customer behaviour in order to losing the status of customer 
# For the TotalCharges variable with status_new coefficent is -0.0002385792 that pretend that it may affect the customer status of losing the service

# using status and partner variable the coefficent of gender is -0.6884348 and it is not statistically significant in the model so it will decrease the probability for losing the customer , that this is not leading the customer behaviour to lose the services

# using status and gender combination of variables the coeffcient is -0.029837 this is also not affecting the customer status to lose the service.

# using status and internetservice combination of shows statiscially significant model in the model fibre optic have positive coeffcient and no internet service have negative coefficient that show option no is not affecting the cuatomer status however who have fibre optic service may influenc the customer behaviour
